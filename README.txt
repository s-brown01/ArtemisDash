This is the files for the game Artemis Dash. It is written by Sean-Paul Brown and John Botonakis, in java.

Descripton of the Artemis Dash:
Inspired by the likes of Super Meat Boy, Contra, and Sonic among others, ARTEMIS DASH is an action platformer, with an emphasis on both speed and tight maneuverability around the dangerous passages within an active volcano! All is not as it seems, however, as there is more than lava to be weary of in this superheated maze. Our hero must dash, zip, shoot, and dodge, all while keeping her wits sharper than the arrows she carries, to brave the treacherous depths, rescue her friend, and escape certain doom! Will you be quick enough?

TO RUN THE GAME:
Copy the repo and run the MainClass.java class!
